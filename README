bar
===

A completely stupid and useless application.

Building
========

 * Mandatory dependency: libfoo
   https://github.com/tpetazzoni/libfoo

 * Optional dependency: libconfig
   http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/

Configuration file
==================

The configuration file must be named 'bar.cfg' and located in the
current working directory. It can be used to specify the following
options:

 - verbose

   with the value "yes", the application will enable verbose
   mode. With any other value, the application will run in normal
   mode.
